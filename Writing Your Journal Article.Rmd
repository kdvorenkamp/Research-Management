This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
```{r}
getwd()
df<-read.csv("Table of Contents.csv")
data.frame(df)
head(df)
```

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)
m<-mermaid(
  paste0(
    # mermaid "header", each component separated with "\n" (line break)
    "gantt", "\n", 
    "dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD", "\n", 
    "title A Very Nice Gantt Diagram", "\n",
    # unite the first two columns (task & status) and separate them with ":"
    # then, unite the other columns and separate them with ","
    # this will create the required mermaid "body"
    paste(df %>%
            unite(i, task, status, sep = " : ") %>%
            unite(j, i, pos, start, end, sep = ", ") %>%
            .$j, 
          collapse = "\n"
    ), "\n"
  )
)

m$x$config = list(ganttConfig = list(
  axisFormatter = list(list(
    "%b %d, %Y"
    ,htmlwidgets::JS(
      'function(d){ return d.getDay() == 1 }'
    )
  ))
))
m
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
